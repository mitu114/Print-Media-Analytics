Provide Insights to Guide a Legacy Newspaper’s Survival in a Post COVID Digital Era


Bharat Herald, a legacy newspaper organization with operations across five Indian states,
is facing an existential crisis. 
With a reputation built over seven decades for multilingual reporting and sharp regional journalism, the company once printed over 1.2 million copies daily.

But between 2019 and 2024, print circulation has dropped to under 560,000. The pandemic accelerated a shift toward digital news consumption, and competitors  quickly adapted with mobile-first platforms, WhatsApp delivery models, and subscription bundles. 

Meanwhile, Bharat Herald’s 2021 e-paper pilot failed due to poor mobile usability and was 
eventually shelved after financial losses.

The result: advertiser confidence declined, vendor payments delayed, and multiple city bureaus shut down. 

Over 60 employees across editorial and sales functions have been let go. A recent internal audit flagged severe fiscal concerns.

In response, Tony Sharma (Executive Director) has initiated a last-mile attempt to assess the business situation. 
A data analyst, Peter Pandey, has been assigned to lead a comprehensive analysis of the company’s operational and financial data from 2019–2024.

Peter’s mandate is clear: quantify what went wrong, identify recovery potential, and recommend a phased roadmap toward digital transformation.
